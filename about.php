	<h1> About This Assignment</h1>
	
	<h2>Special Features</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>I have turned all the links into buttons to make the layout look better.</li>
			<li>Added a background image</li>
			<li>Changed the font style</li>
			<li>Added a hover functionality to the buttons so you can see when the mouse moves over it.</li>
			<li>Made sure that you can only ever have 5 characters in the status code box. </li>
			
			
		</ul>
		
	<h2>What parts did I have trouble with?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The most trouble I encountered with this assignment was writing the code to check that all the user inputs were correct. </li>
			<li>The CSS was initially quite difficult as had never really done any of this before.</li>
			
		</ul>

	<h2>What would you like to do better next time? </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Next time i would like to further enhance my knowledge  of CSS. I don't particularly like the look of big white input boxes so I would look at some way to trade that out.</li>
			<li>I think my code could be improved to be more efficient</li>
			<li>Improve the layout.</li>
			
		</ul>
